# Tumor Segmentation With the Kits23 Dataset

See the Kits23 dataset [here](https://github.com/neheller/kits23)!

## Running this project
You can clone the repo directly into here so the data is in `kits23\dataset\`, for instructions on getting the segmentation files, see the [Kits23 dataset](https://github.com/neheller/kits23).

It is recommended to create a new virutal environment with conda using the `requirements.txt` file.

Once all requirements have been installed you should be able to train the model with train.py (note that you may have to change hyperparameters depending on your computer to get it to run).
