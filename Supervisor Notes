- Research into more recent Kits23 SOTA implementations, try to find best score.
- Extended research, once model is built, test the model on not just KiTS23, but extend to other datasets.
- Get a better baseline, improve the model baseline first before looking into novel ideas. Take a good model, then look into improvements and novel ideas that I can introduce.
